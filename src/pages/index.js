    <h2 id="welcome">A whole new type of occupancy sensor.</h2>

    <p>
      <strong>Hiome Door</strong> is a small sensor for your door, a giant leap for presence detection.
      It knows exactly how many people are in each room, even if you haven't moved for hours.
      No more waving your arms around to turn the lights back on.
    </p>

    <h2>Precision engineered for accuracy.</h2>
    <p>
      Hiome Door has 65 sensing points to reliably detect you. It's smart enough know what direction you're moving, so it
      can count every entry and exit to know how many people are still in each room. It can also tell you if your door is open or
      closed.

    <h2>Faster than the blink of an eye.</h2>

    <p>Hiome Door looks for changes in occupancy every 100 milliseconds. For comparison, the human eye takes 300ms to blink.
    In addition to making your automations more accurate, it saves you money by making sure your home is running as efficiently as possible.
    Don't leave lights burning electricity for an empty room again.

    <h2>Built for privacy.</h2>
    <p>
      There are no cameras or microphones. In fact, Hiome Door can't see in your room at all. Instead, it detects body heat near the door
      to know when somebody enters or exits. There's nothing to carry, so your home works for your guests too. All this in a device so
      small, you'll forget it's even there.
    </p>

    <h2>Simple to install.</h2>
    <p>
      Hiome Door has a sleek, minimalist design that lets it blend in with any style. There's no batteries to replace.
      Instead, we include a 20 foot (6 meter) microUSB cable, slim power adapter, and gaffer tape, the premium cotton mask
      that Hollywood uses to hide wires on movie sets. You'll be surprised how invisible everything is.

    <h2>Smarter together.</h2>
    <p>
      Hiome Door talks to Hiome Core, the brains of the Hiome system, to seamlessly sync all of your sensors. Your automations
      keep working even if your room has multiple doors, and Hiome always knows if the room is occupied or not, so the lights
      only turn off when the last person leaves.

    <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

    <h4>How does Hiome Door differ from motion sensors?</h4>
    <p>
      Ever had to wave your arms to turn the lights back on, or wait for them to turn off after you leave?
      Thatâ€™s because motion sensors detect motion, not occupancy. They can try to guess at occupancy based on when they last
      saw motion, but that creates false negatives and delays in your automations. Hiome Door detects actual occupancy,
      whether or not you're moving.
    </p>

    <h4>Why not just use a voice assistant?</h4>
    <p>
      Controlling your home with your voice feels magical at first, but it quickly becomes tiring and repetitive. As the number
      of connected devices in your home grows, the complexity of remembering every name and command becomes overwhelming, making
      it feel like a command-line interface. Grandpa shouldn't have to remember what you named the pendant lights in the living room.
    </p>

    <h4>Is the tape removable?</h4>
    <p>
      Yup! Gaffer tape is specifically designed for use on movie sets and stage productions, so it can be very easily applied and removed
      without any risk of damage to your walls or mouldings. The sensor uses standard double-sided 3M tape to attach to your door frame,
      which is also easily removed and replaceable.
